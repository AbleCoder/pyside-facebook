pyside-facebook
===============

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/AbleCoder/pyside-facebook.png)](http://travis-ci.org/AbleCoder/pyside-facebook)

A general purpose PySide library to interact with facebook's API.


Currently this includes a user authentication widget (extending a QWebView) that allows a user to authenticate and accept app permissions through Facebook's OAuth Dialog.

The plan is to eventually include helper methods to ease some interactions with the graph API like uploading photos, posting on the user's wall, and more.
